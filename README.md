# Experimental Evolution Sequence Data Repository

Repository holding all information (and some data) collected from the analysis of laboratory experimentally evolved *Drosophila melanogaster* flies



**[RunThrough_DataCleaning.md](https://github.com/PaulKnoops/Experimental_Evolution_Sequence_Repo/blob/master/RunThrough_DataCleaning.md)** is
 the outline for data cleaning, filtering, mapping etc. to end with a final .bam file for each of the 13 sequences and a .sync file used through popoolation and custom analysis.
 
 **[Analysis_after_BAM.md](https://github.com/PaulKnoops/Experimental_Evolution_Sequence_Repo/blob/master/Analysis_after_BAM.md)** shows the analysis steps for the data, including Pi, Fst, a custom model, and selection coefficients of the data, as well as other analysis
